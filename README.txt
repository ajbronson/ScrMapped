This was a pretty difficult assignment, in my opinion! I tried to reference several online articles and examples to see how to use media queries properly.  

I was able to complete most of the requirements, but not all of them.  I couldn't get a line break inserted between the title and the breadcrumbs. I'd like to learn more about this in class or continue reading examples.
